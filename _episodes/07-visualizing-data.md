At the end of the last lesson we wrote a new program that calculated the to 49 city's contribution
to the overall emissions. An example of what this program might look like is available 
[here](../code/city_emissions_contribution.py). 

The purpose of creating the `HistoricalCO2Emissions` class was so that we could re-use it for
our analysis task. So let's see how to do that now. We're going to create a new program
called `city_emissions_contribution.py` that will determine the contribution that the city emissions 
make to the global emissions.
